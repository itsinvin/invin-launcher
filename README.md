# Quartz Launcher

Quartz Launcher is an enhanced fork of [PandoraLauncher](https://github.com/Moulberry/PandoraLauncher) — a modern, native Minecraft launcher built with Rust and GPUI. It keeps Pandora's full feature set and adds new tools on top.

**Repository:** https://github.com/itsinvin/QuartzLauncher

## Features

Everything from Pandora, including:

- Instance management with cards and list views
- Cross-instance file syncing (options, saves, resource packs, and more)
- Mod deduplication via hard links when installed through the launcher
- Secure account credential storage using platform keyrings
- Custom game output window
- Modrinth and CurseForge content browsers
- Automatic redaction of sensitive information in logs
- Import from other launchers
- Unique modpack management workflow

Quartz enhancements:

- **Performance estimator** (Tools → Performance) — hardware-aware FPS and RAM estimates for modded workloads. This is one utility among many, not the focus of the launcher.
- Rebranded UI and data paths under `QuartzLauncher`

## Building

Requires a recent Rust toolchain (edition 2024).

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Platform-specific packaging scripts live in `scripts/`:

- `scripts/build_linux.sh`
- `scripts/build_windows.sh`
- `scripts/build_mac.sh`

## FAQ

### Where can I suggest a feature or report a bug?

Please use GitHub issues on this repository.

### Why Quartz instead of Pandora?

Quartz is a community fork that preserves Pandora's architecture and features while adding optional tools (like performance estimation) and independent branding. It is not affiliated with the original Pandora project.

### Will Quartz be monetized?

No. Quartz follows the same philosophy as Pandora: no ads, no monetization.
